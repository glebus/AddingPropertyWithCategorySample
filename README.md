AddingPropertyWithCategorySample
================================

Project demonstrates how to add a property to an instance of the class using categories.

Officially, categories were created to extend existing classes with <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/General/Conceptual/DevPedia-CocoaCore/Category.html">new methods</a>. But sometimes 
there is a need to add to the expanding class of new property. To implement this trick, 
we need methods runtime. In order to see how it's done enough to see <a href="https://github.com/glebus/AddingPropertyWithCategorySample/blob/master/Category/NSObject%2BExt.m">here</a>.
